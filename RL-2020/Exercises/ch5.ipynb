The second term, $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln n}{n_j}}$, is the newness term and is for exploration. The parameter $C_p$ is the tuneable exploration/exploitation parameter. The selection rule then is to select the child with the hightest UCT value. This can then either be a node which has a high winrate or a high newness value. So the 'goodness' value of a node can be determine by either a good exploration or exploitation value and the important thing is that there is a well adjusted balance between the two."
