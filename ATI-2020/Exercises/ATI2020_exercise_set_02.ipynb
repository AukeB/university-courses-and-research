An obvious approach for a positive two-lens system where both lenses are made from the same material to fulfill the Petzval condition is to choose a positive followed by a negative lens with the same absolute value of the focal length but opposite signs. Show that this combination can still act as a positive lens.\n",

I experimented with different sizes of the imaging point (the green handle) to find the optimum. For minimizing the spherical abberation I have found $R_1 = 59.4$ mm and $R_2 = -275$ mm. This gives an average rms spot radius of 0.564. I have not been able to find a lower rms value for different radii values, so I believe this must be near the optimum."
