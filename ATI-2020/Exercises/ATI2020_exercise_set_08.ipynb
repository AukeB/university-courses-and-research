    "We will finish with a quick examination of some of the effects that the simulation you made above does not take into account. The final performance of an AO system depends on these sources of error. The William Herschel Telescope has a mirror diameter of 4.2 m, and typical values for atmospheric parameters are an $r_0$ of 0.25 m at 550 nm, a wind speed of 5 m/s, a time lag in the AO control of 2 ms, and other errors producing 40 nm rms wavefront error. Assume the deformable mirror has a continuous face sheet with a subaperture diameter of 0.4 m. \n",
