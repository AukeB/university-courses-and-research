    "**Answer**: Paraxially, the two systems should give the same results, but there are abberations. The average rms spot size is approximately 4 times lower in the second design. If you compare the two figures to each other, the rays are changed in direction 4 times as much in the second design w.r.t. the first design. This means the angles of refraction are smaller in the second design w.r.t. the first design, which has as a consequence that the paraxial approximation gives better results in the second design, and abberations are less impactful in the second design. For example, spherical abberation, which is the consequence of the fact that rays are reflected more or less in the outer regions of the lens than the rays that go through to center of the lens. Clearly spherical abberation plays a lesser part in the second design."
