    "- **Chromatic abberations**: Different wavelengths will have different focal lengths. This can be solved using multiple kinds of glass.\n",
    "- **Long telescope tubes**: Because astromers desire large magnifcations, telescopes became larger and larger. This is a limitations, because it increases the weight and the mounting of the telescope needs to be stronger, which makes it harder to fabricate.\n",

    "The hard thing about making a good lense, is making the glass homogeneous. The cooling process of the glass needs to be controlled, on order to prevent air bubles or strays. Glass also sags under gravity. This means that there is a limit that determines the maximum size of a lens."

By having the mirror set up at the bottom of the telescope tube, much larger telescopes could be made. The primary focus is awkward to get to. Introducing a secondary mirror can relay the focus to a more convenient location.\n",

Because there is a focus at the primary mirror, it means you can set up a heat stop, which is important for a solar telescope. For large telescopes which have adaptive optics, a concave (ellipsoid) mirror makes testing and calibration during the day easier w.r.t a convec (hyperbolic) mirror.\n",
    "- **The Cassegrain telescope**, which has a hyperboloidal mirror as secondary mirror. This shortens the length of the telescope up to 20 percent, w.r.t. the Gregorian, but its access to the primary access is worse. By choosing the right value for the conic constant of the second mirror, the spherical abberation can be canceled out. However, if you move off-axix, there is still coma and astigmatism.\n",

    "All two mirror telescopes have field curvature. All astronomical sources off-axis require a curved focal plane to get them in focus.\n",

Telescopes with these values are known as Richey-Chrétien telescopes. Many telescopes use this design, for example the VLC, GTC, Subaru, Keck (2x) and the Gemini (2x)."

    "The Smidt telescopes have a larger field of view than the Cassegrain and Gregorian designs, this allowed the catalogue-ing of stars and galaxies to happen. The principle of the Schmidt telescope is that it has a spherical mirror as primary. It has a curved focal plane as secondary mirror. The spherical abgeration will be minimized by having an undersized stop at the radius of curvature. An aspheric corrector plate widens the field of view and can reduce the spherical abberation. The addition of a secondary mirror can send the light through the primary, to make it a Schmidt-Cassegrain design.\n",

    "The classical method of mirror making is by first taking a cube and then polishing it until it reaches the required conic shape. However, large mirrors made in this way can't cool fast enough w.r.t. the outside air. Because of this, the quality of the mirror drops fast over time. A new method was developed of mirror making which solves several of these problems. This method is known as spin casting. The glass melts while the oven spins. Also, using this method air can go throught the whole in the middle. There is temperature control because of air jet cooling.\n",

    "Using an Altitude-azimuth mouting is the prefferd option because of computer controlling. Each object can be tracked using the two axis of rotation. However, the Zenith is inaccessible due to azimuth drive speed. Also, the object rotates throughout the night in the field of view. This can be canceled by rotating the entire instrument or a derotator: K-mirror, dove prism or anything rotatable with an odd number of reflections.\n",
