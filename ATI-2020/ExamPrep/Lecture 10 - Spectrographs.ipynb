Each individual image of a star is smeared out across the detector into a small spectrum $\\rightarrow$ Handy when you want to characterise large quantities of stars simultaneously. Solution to spectrum overlaying each other is taking multiple observations from differenct directions. Slitless spectrographs can also be used on extended objects.\n",

    "**Anamorphic magnification**: Means that magnification along mutually perpendicular radii is different. Anamorphic magnification arises because\n",

    "at a large angle from the camera normal,\n",
    "and is defined as $r$.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The slit**: We cannot record three dimensions of data (x,y, wavelength) onto a two dimensional detector, so we need to choose how we fill up our detector are. For a seeing limited object, such as a star, varying the slit width is a balance between spectral resolution and throughput. Slit too wide, spectral resolution goes down. Slit too narrow, flux from seeing limited object is lost.\n",
