It is useful to describe the Stokes parameters in terms of polarization-filtered intensity measurements. $I$ is the intensity, $Q$ and $U$ desribe linear polarization and $V$ describes circular polarization. Polarimetry is therefore differential photometry, because when using stokes parameters, you are subtracting different kind of intensity measurements from each other. Fractinoal stokes parameters means everything is divided by $I$, so everything will have a value between $-1$ and $1$.\n",
