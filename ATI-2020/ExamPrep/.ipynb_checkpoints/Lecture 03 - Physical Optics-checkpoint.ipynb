    "Diffraction occurs when you have an obstable that blocks part of a wave, and that wave then bends around the corner and spreads out. If the aperture is large, the spread is small and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to calculate diffraction, you have to solve the wave equation together with boundary constraints. This is difficult, and analytical solutions exist only for a few special cases. There are many numerical approaces to solve such problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Huygens-Fresnel Principle is useful for many applications. This principle states that every point on a wavefront is itself the source of spherical wavelets, and the secondary wavelets emanating from different points mutually interfere.\n",

    "If $F >> 1$ you have to use the angular spectrum method, it is the only way to get the correct diffraction pattern. If, on the other hand, $F \\approx 1$, you can use the Fresnel approximation. Lastly, if $F << 1$, you can use the Fraunhofer approximation, because the waves can be approximated by plane waves in the far field.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a telescope, the Fraunhofer approximation is valid, because there is optics between the aperture and the detector. These optics bring the far field to a finite distance."
