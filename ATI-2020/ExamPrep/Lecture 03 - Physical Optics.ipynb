    "Diffraction occurs when you have an obstable that blocks part of a wave, and that wave then bends around the corner and spreads out. If the aperture is large, the spread is small and vice versa.\n",

    "If we want to calculate diffraction, you have to solve the wave equation together with boundary constraints. This is difficult, and analytical solutions exist only for a few special cases. There are many numerical approaces to solve such problems. \n",
