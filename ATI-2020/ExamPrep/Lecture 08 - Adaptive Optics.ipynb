There is an outer scale and inner scale length ($L_0$ and $l_0$), and the power spectrum of index fluctuations running between these two scales. Turbulence isn't homogenous throughout the atmosphere, but is concentrated at different altitudes, which can be from 2 to 5 km depending on the telescope site and the season. Each thin layer of this turbulent atmosphere is described with fried length and the mean velocity of the layer. By integrating out the $C_n^2$ profile, an estimate of the seeing can be calculated."
