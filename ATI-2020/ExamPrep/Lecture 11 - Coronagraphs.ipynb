    "Bernard Lyot was a French astronomer and istrument maker who wanted to study the Sun's corona without waiting for an eclipse. He invented the coronagraph in 1939 to block sunlight and take photos of the corona.\n",

    "It took a large amount of time before it discovered something. First circumstellar disk was imaged in 1984. First evidence that infrared excesses measured by all sky surveys in the IR were due to flattened disks of dust - sites of planet formation.\n",

    "I would be take another large amount of time before the next disk would be discovered, AU Mic in 2004.\n",

    "Coronagraphs are a way of blocking the central light of the central star, while the light from just besides the star (where planets are) shines through. The goal is to minimize the diffracted light close to the star."
