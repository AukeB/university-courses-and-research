    "Maxwell's equations lead directly to eletromagnetic waves. They describe electromagnetic waves, not matter. So if we want to study optics, which is defined as the interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter, we also need equations that describe matter. This can be done with the linear material equations.\n",

    "The dielectric constant $\\epsilon$(also known as the vacuum permittivity) relates the electric displacement to the electric field. A dieletric (material) is an electric insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field. In a dielectric material, the presence of an electric field $\\vec{E}$ causes the bound charges in the material (atomic nuclei and their electrons) to slightly separate, inducing a local electric dipole moment.  \n",
    "The permeability $\\mu$ is the measure of magnetization that a material obtains in response to an applied magnetic field. $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic induction and $\\vec{H}$ the magnetic field.  \n",
    "The electrical conductivity $\\sigma$ represents a material's ability to conduct electric current. $\\vec{j}$ is the electric current density.\n",
    "    \n",
    "These equations are linear relations and are assumptions of the simplest form that explain a lot of optics. These are also a good approximation in astronomy, since light does not change in material. \n",
    "\n",
    "In vacuum, $\\epsilon = 1$, $\\mu = 1$ and $\\sigma = 0$, because there is no matter and no charge  carriers. In isotropic media, $\\epsilon$ and $\\mu$ are scalars. In anisotropic media (e.g. crystals), $\\epsilon$ and $\\mu$ are tensors of rank 2 (matrices). This is because in different directions the matter behaves differently. However, the assumption of isotropy depends on wavelength. For example, if the wavelength becomes as small as the spacing between atoms, you can not make the assumption of isotropy anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electromagnetic waves are vector waves, which leads to polarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a static, homogeneous medium with no net electric charges ($\\rho = 0$, and for most materials $\\mu = 1$), combining the Maxwell equations and linear material equations lead to these differential quations for damped (vector) wave.\n",

    "There is a second derivative to space, a second derivative to time, and a first derivative to time where the damping comes from. The damping is controlled by the conductivity. The electric and magnetic field are the same except for a multiplicative, complex scalar. So, it is sufficient to only consider the electric field. However, at boundaries (the transition from one piece of matter to another piece of matter) you have to consider both, because the boundary conditions are different."

    "When substituting the plane-wave solution into Maxwell's equations, additional constraints arise. The electric field, magnetic field and the wave vector are all orthogonal to each other, and both the electric and magnetic field are not in the direction of the wave so they are transverse waves. The form a right-handed vector triple. This was all  in isotropic media. When in conducting media, there is a complex index of refraction, and the electric and magnetic field are out of phase.\n",

The most common alternative way of calculating $n$, instead of getting it from an empirically obtained table, is using the Sellmeier equation. Each glass has three Sellmeier coefficients, and the equation has as input a wavelength and as output an index of refrection. However, this equation is only applicable over a certain wavelength.\n",
