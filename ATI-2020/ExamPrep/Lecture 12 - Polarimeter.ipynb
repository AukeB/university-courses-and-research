    "The basics, how do we describe a polarization measurement? We do this with the Stokes parameters. Most detectors, if not all, measure only intensity, they count photons. It is useful to describe the Stokes parameters in terms of polarization-filtered intensity measurements. $I$ is the intensity, $Q$ and $U$ desribe linear polarization and $V$ describes circular polarization. Polarimetry is therefore differential photometry, because when using stokes parameters, you are subtracting different kind of intensity measurements from each other. Fractinoal stokes parameters means everything is divided by $I$, so everything will have a value between $-1$ and $1$.\n",

    "2. Each optic that is not perfectly rotationally symmetric induces instrumental polarization and/or modifies the incoming polarization. $\\rightarrow$ The end-to-end polarimetric response need to be calibrated.\n",
    "3. The polarization measurement needs to be integrated with imaging and/or spectral measurements. $\\rightarrow$ Polarimeters need to be optimized at systems level, and fully integrated in the design from the very beginning."
