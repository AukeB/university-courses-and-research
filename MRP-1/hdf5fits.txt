 ### Files ###

File 1: /data5/bruinsma/general_documents/lapalma_fits_info.txt
Contains JDMID, LSTMID, NEXP, BINNED data for each .fits file, for each camera in period of 2017-2018, extracted from the headers of the .fits files located in /data5/mascara/LaPalma

File 2: /data5/bruinsma/stars/559508/559508_lapalma_moredata.txt
Contains JDMID, LST, LSTSEQ, MAG0, NOBS, X, Y data of star 559508 (just a random star), extracted from the .hdf5 file in /data3/mascara/reduced

File 3: /data5/bruinsma/stars/982823/982823_lapalma_moredata.txt
Same as file 2, but for a different star.

 ### First example ###

CTRL+F in file 2 for '2017Q1 - Camera: C'. Copy the jdmid and CTRL+F it in file 1.
1. The JDMID and LST don't exactly match from file 1 and file 2. LST difference is somewhere around 0.03 and JD somewhere around 0.002.
2. The NOBS in in file 2 isn't the same as NEXP/BINNING in file 1.
3. If you go to /data5/mascara/LaPalma/20170101LSC/binned, the files have the structure YYYYMMDDT and then the time. This time doesn't match the LST in file 1 or file 2, but seems to be around 5 hours off.

 ### Second example ###

CTRL+F in file 3 for '2017Q2 - Camera: C'. Copy the first jdmid of that period and CTRL+F it in file 1.
1. In file 3 there are 4 observations of star 982823 that night. As you can see in file 1, these are the 4 last binned images of the first night of April, which makes sense because that is the first night of the second quarter.
2. The JDMID's and LSTMID's from file 1 and file 3 don't exactly match.
3. The NOBS from file 3 doesn't match with NEXP/BINNING from file 1.
4. Here also the LST in the files don't match the one in the filename
