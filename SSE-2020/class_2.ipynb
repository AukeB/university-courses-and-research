    "**Answer**: Since the core temparture of a star is much higher than the surface temperature, the star cannot be in global TE, but it is in LTE, local thermodynamic equilibrium. Local means at distance much smaller than $R_\\odot$, but significantly larger than te mean free path $l_\\text{ph}$. The temperature gradient in this small region is zero, however, it is not exactly zero, ofcourse there is an extremely small temperature gradient, which is enough to let the energy flow outwards."

    "**Answer**: Degeneracy pressure is related to the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle states the following: \"Two or more identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state in the same quantum system simultaneously.\" Electrons, which are fermions with two spin states, i.e. $g_e = 2$, have therefore a maximum number density allowed by quantum mechanics which depend on the momentum $p$. The limitation imposed by the Pauli exclusion principle means taht electrons can exert a higher pressure than predicted by classical physics; electrons are forced to assume quantum sates iwth higher $p$, because the quantum states with lower $p$ are already occupied. Because of the higher momenta, there is a higher pressure. This is called *degeneracy pressure*. The pressure becomes independent of temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a star contracts, the density may becomes so high that the electrons become degenerate and exert a much higher pressure than they would if they behaved classically. This pressure can hold the star up against gravity, regardless of the temperature. It can remain in this state forever even when it cools down, this is the case for White dwarfs. Degeneracy of neutrons becomes important when *neutron stars* are considered."
