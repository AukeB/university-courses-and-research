    "(a) Why does the luminosity of a star increase on the main sequence? Why do low-mass stars, like the Sun, expand less during the main sequence than higher-mass stars?"

    "**Answer**: During the MS, H is converted into He. So over the course of time, there are more ashes in the core than fuel. Less fuel per unit mass in the core means a gradual lowering of the nuclear fusion rate. Since it is the ouflow of the energy from nuclear reactions in the core that provides the counterforce to the gravitational contraction, the core will compress more to a higher pressure and temperature. This results in more nuclear reactions and therefore the luminosity of a star during MS will increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mirror principle states that expansion of the envelope occurs when the core contracts, and vice versa. Low-mass stars have a lower core temperature compared to a high mass stars. This means the nuclear reaction rate is lower, and therefore the MS phase is also lower. Lower mass stars $M < 0.4 M_\\odot$  have are fully convective, while higher mass stars $M > 1.3 M_\\odot$ only have a convective core. This means fuel in lower mass stars is able to be replenished from all region of star and therefore the nuclear reaction rate will gradually decrease in a much slower rate than for high mass stars."

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer**: A Gap in the HR-diagram means that the time a stars spends in that region is relatively much shorter than it spends in other place. In the case of Hertzsprung gap, it does not mean it does not spend time there, it goes through it in rough $10^5$ years, which is relatively short. After the MS, intermediate mass stars start their H-shell burning phase. Initially, this is quit slow. The He core gradually increases its math until it surpasses the SC limit, and the contraction of the core speeds up. This is an accelerating process. Eventually the H-shell supply is all burned\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not happen for low mass stars because the SC-limit is not exceeded because the core is hel up by electron degeneracy pressure. So the SC limit has become irrelevant for low mass stars."

    "(d) Why does the envelope become convective on the red giant branch? What is the link with the Hayashi line?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: The envelope becomes convective because not all the energy can be trasnported by radiation. This is the case bacause the temperature in the envelope has decreased and therefore the envelope has a large opacity $\\kappa$. The envelope has a smaller temperature because it has expanded, because the core has contracted, because of the increase of the core temperature.\n",
