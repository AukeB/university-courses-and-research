    "**Answer**: The Hayashi line is an almost vertical line in the HR-diagram where stars are fully convective ($T_{eff}$ is constant). Pre-main sequence stars start their evolution from this line, but the Hayashi line is not exclusive to pre-main sequence stars, it is all for all kinds of stars, as long as they are fully convective. The region to the right of Hayashi line in the HDR is a forbidden region for stars in HE; $T_{eff}$ is lower there. The region to the left cannot be fully temperature and must have some portion of their interior in radiative equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "That fact that it is almost a vertical line means that the star evolves in such a way that the luminosity changes (decreases for pre-MS stars), while the effective temperature stays constant. A star being fully convective can have a large range of luminosities, while having a constant effective temperature. This is the case because such stars can be said to be adiabatic, meaning that the temperature gradient is equal to $\\nabla_\\text{ad}$. An arbitrarily high energy flux can be carried by such a temperature gradient and therefore the luminosity of the star is independent of its structure, hence the vertical line."

    "**Answer**: The region to the right of Hayashi line in the HDR is a forbidden region for stars in HE; $T_{eff}$ is lower there. This would mean $\\nabla > \\nabla_\\text{ad}$ and the star must have a superadiabatic temperature gradient. This gives rise to a very large convective energy flux, which trasports heat outwards very rapidly, which has as a consequence that the temperature decreases, until $\\nabla$ equals $\\nabla_\\text{ad}$ again. So stars with a small deviation to the right will automatically be restructured back to the HL."

    "**Answer**: For ZAMS stars H-burning has just ignited. H-burning occurs in these stars at the moment a certain core temperature and pressure threshold has been surpassed. This threshold is the same for the stars with the same mass, therefore there is a relation between the mass and the luminosity of a ZAMS star. More massive stars have higher core temperatures, therefore higher nuclear reaction rate and a higher luminosity"

    "(e) Use the homology relations for the luminosity and temperature of a star to derive how the central temperature in a star scales with mass, and find the dependence of $T_c$ on $M$ for the pp-chain and for the CNO-cycle. To make the result quantitative, use the fact that in the Sun with $ T \\approx 1.3 \\cdot 10^7 \\text{ K}$ the pp-chain dominates, and that the CNO-cycle dominates for masses $M > 1.3 M_{\\text{Sun}}$ (Why does the pp-chain dominate at low mass and the CNO-cycle at high mass?)
