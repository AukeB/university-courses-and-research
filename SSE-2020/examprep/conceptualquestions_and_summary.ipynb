    "**A**: (1) Nuclear reactions produce the energy within a star which keeps them in TE and which is why we see them shine. Stars are radiating away energy and to keep them into balance, nuclear reactions produce almost exactly the same amount of energy that is radiating away from the star. They determine for how long the star is able to sustain its liminosity. (2) Nuclear reactions are responsible for the conversion of elements within stars, for example, from H to He, so nuclear reactions make the existence of heavier elements than H happen. From a larger perspective, stars are slowly converting the universe from a state where there were no metals, to a state with less and less H and a higher overall metallicity."

    "**A**: (1) Convection allows the star to transport energy from within a star to the surface, for example, at lower temperature, when radiative transport is not able to transport all the energy, because of the low opacity. Convection is a very efficient way of transporting energy. (2) If the core is convective, convection is able to 'mix' the star, in very short timescales (weeks to months), by transporting heavier elements from the core to the surface, we are even able to observe H from high up to the core, so more fuel is present in the core, and the H-burning phase can prolong longer."

    "**A**: Because of the Coulomb barrier. Two nuclei experience a coulomb potential that scales with the product of their charges and inversely with their distance. Classically, nuclear reactions are not able to happen at temperatures of stellar cores. However, if quantum mechanics is taken into consideration, there is a finite chance  particle breaks the repulsive Coulomb barrier (known as the tunnel effect), which scales steeply with the energy and decreases with the product of the charges. So, at low $T$, only the lightest nuclei will react and heavier nuclei require higher $T$, and therefore higher energies to have a compariable penetration probability."

When HE stars burning, all nuclear energy goes into raising the internal energy, because the the degeneracy pressure is independent of $T$. Eventually, degeneracy is lifted when $T = 3 \\cdot 10^8$ K. After that the gas starts behaving like an ideal gas, so there is expansion and cooling. All of this energy results of the expansion of the core, and none of this energy reached the surface. Further expansion and cooling decreases the energy generation rate and further nuclear burning is stable. The high local luminosity $l$ makes the region where it occurs become convective, therefore the product, 12C, is mixed through the core."

    "A star in which nuclear burning occurs in a convective cor will homogenize the region inside core. Ashes from the core are transported outwards and more fuel is transported inwards, so the core can extend its lifetime. A star with a deep convective envelope trasnports core material to the outer layers, this is knows as dredge-up. A star can have multiple dredge-up phases during its lifetime.\n",

    "Convective overshooting happens out the Schwarzschild boundary; when a convective bubble crosses this boundary the superadiabaticity and the $\\mu$-gradient also decreases. Because of this the effective buoyance force that brakes the elements also decreases and a positive feedback loop can develop. This allows convective overshooting to penetrete much furter and further. The effect of this mechanism can be very significant, especially in high mass stars."
