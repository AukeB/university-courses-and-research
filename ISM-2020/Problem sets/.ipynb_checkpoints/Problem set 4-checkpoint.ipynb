As you can see, this is treated as a 5-level system here (levels labeled from 0 to 4), but  fortunately we will be able to make some useful simplifications."

    "(b) Now make the following (good) approximations: (i) the only important spontaneous transitions are the transitions indicated by arrows in Draine Fig. 18.1 (right-hand panel); these are 4→3, 4→1, 3→2 and 3→1; all other spontaneous transitions can be ignored; (ii) the large majority of the ions is in the ground-state (level 0); (iii) we are in the low-density limit. With these approximations, write down expressions for the rate of change of the populations of levels 4 and 3 (so for dn4/dt and dn3/dt)."

If the spins are antiparallel, we have ortho-H$_2$ for which only odd values of J are possible. Radiative transitions between ortho- and para-H$_2$ are strongly forbidden; however, transitions between ortho- and para-H$_2$ may occur by collisions (at a low rate). Here we are going to estimate if this process is sufficiently effective that significant mixing between the ortho- and para-species occurs. Let H$_2$(J) denote H$_2$ with rotational quantum number J.
