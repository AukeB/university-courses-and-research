    "We have seen that certain line ratios are temperature-independent and can be used to measure density in a certain density range. But in the limits of high or low densities these line ratios become constant (see for instance Fig. 18.4 in Draine). Here we are going to calculate expressions for the values that the line ratios obtain in the high-density limit and the low-density limit. To be specific, we are going to consider a ratio like that of the [OII] lines at 3729.8 Å and 3727.1 Å. The energy level diagram is given in Draine, Fig. 18.3. We are going to simplify this by only considering levels 0, 1 and 2 (and ignore the higher levels). So we are considering a 3-level system.\n",
    "In addition we make the simplification that there are no transitions (radiative or collisional) between levels 1 and 2, and that the energies of levels 1 and 2 are so close that we can ignore the energy difference (these are good approximations). Recall that the collisional deexcitation rate $k_{10}$ can be written as\n",

    "$T_4$ is the temperature in units of 104 K and $\\Omega_{10}$ is a dimensionless number (called the collision strength), which does not depend on $T$. Derive expressions (in terms of only collision strengths, Einstein $A$ values and level degeneracies) for the line ratio in the low-density limit and in the high-density limit. Assume that both lines are optically thin. You will also need to use the relation between the collisional excitation rate and deexcitation rates, which is given by\n",

Radiative transitions between ortho- and para-H$_2$ are strongly forbidden; however, transitions between ortho- and para-H$_2$ may occur by collisions (at a low rate).
