    "**Nebulae** (1.2): To think of the ISM in terms of nebulae is a kind of old way. Here is this nebula, and there is that dark cloud and finding things out of those visually distinct objects is old-fasioned. It is also the way it is presented in amateur books. There are 4 classical distinct classical objects: HII regions (including Planetary Nebulae), reflection nebulae, dark (molecular) clouds and supernova remnants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HII regions**: Gas clouds that are photoionized. There are young stars that produce UV-photons that are able to photoionize atoms and molecules in a gas cloud surrounding the young hot star. Associated with massive star-formation regions. Their spectra is dominated by H and He recombination lines and collisiionally excited lines. Strong thermal emission (free-free) + IR emission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reflection Nebulae**: There are not nebulae that are self-luminous, like HII-regions; they just reflect like. Importnat thing to relize is that light is not reflected by atoms or molecules but by dust grains. Simply by looking at a pictures, it is not distinguisable from HII regions. We can tell the difference by looking at the spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dark clouds**: You can see them with the naked eye, even from Holland. You can see dark patches in the Milky Way. Again, what is important, is that the dust is doing the absorption. Dust reradiates the absorbed photons in the IR.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supernova remnants**: Ejecta + swept-up gas from supernova explosion. They fade away, currently there about 100 SNRs visible in the MW. Filamentary and shell-like structures. They are not photo-ionized by a hot central star, because there is not one. They are ionized by collisionally excited lines."

    "**Interstellar Medium** (1.2): It is not the volume between the stars, since the heliosphere extends to about 200 AU. Stars occupy $3 \\cdot 10^{-10}$ of volume, the remaining volume is interstellar and intergalactic space. ISM consists mostly of hydrogen, helium and traces of metals. All of the material can be ionized, neutral or molecular. It can also be in the gas phase or in solid state (dust, ice). Usually, ice sits on top of the dust grains. And then there are magnetic fields and cosmic rays (relativistic particles). The modern of thinking of the ISM (contrary to thinking of the ISM in terms of objects) is in terms of phases.\n",
